# TASK: Consumer-Ready AI Chat Platform with 1-2-3 Deployment

## Objective: Create a complete consumer-ready AI chat platform with IDE capabilities, zero-configuration deployment, and 3-step activation process for end users.

## STEPs:
[✓] STEP 1: SKIP RESEARCH - Assume standard needs and build immediately -> System STEP
[ ] STEP 2: Build the complete self-contained AI chat platform with onboarding, multi-window interface, code editor, iframe support, Plotly integration, and LLM connectivity. -> Web Development STEP  
[ ] STEP 3: Deploy and test the working platform with public access. -> Web Development STEP

## Consumer Experience (1-2-3 Activation):
**Step 1**: Visit www.websitechat.com (or similar accessible URL)
**Step 2**: Complete guided setup wizard that:
   - Asks simple questions about intended use
   - Requests LLM API credentials (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
   - Selects pre-configured templates
   - Sets up personalized environment
**Step 3**: Instant launch of fully configured AI chat platform

## Deliverable: 
- Complete production-ready AI chat platform
- Fully hosted and accessible via public URL
- Zero-configuration deployment experience
- Guided onboarding with credential setup
- Pre-configured templates and examples
- Advanced IDE capabilities (code execution, iframe, Plotly)
